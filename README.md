# Introduction

⚾ The goal of this project is to build a Data Warehouse system gathering the pitching and batting data of all Yankees' games since 1950.

🐍 The data is available in the 'source_data' folder and was obtained, gathered and pre-filtered separately using python and the MLB-statsapi package.
