# Introduction

⚾ The goal of this project is to build a Data Warehouse system gathering the pitching and batting data of all Yankees' games since 1950.

🐍 The data is available in the ['source_data'](source_data/) folder and was obtained, gathered and pre-filtered separately using python and the [MLB-statsapi](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI/tree/master) package.

# Background

🏟️ Passionate about data and about the Yankees, I wanted to take the opportunity to join my two passions and use baseball statistics to practice and train my skills in building a proper data pipeline.

### My main goals with this project:

* Build a database gathering basic batting and pitching statistics, teams, games and players' information. 📊
* Build interactive dashboards to explore different aspects of the data 📉
* Share my work with others, using as much French as possible in the dashboard, as my main target audience is baseball fans from France 🇫🇷
* Develop my skills in data analytics tools and build best practice habits
